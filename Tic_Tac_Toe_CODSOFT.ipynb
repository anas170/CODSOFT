        "# **Explanation** :\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize the Board**: The game board is represented as a list called `board`. It's initialized with nine empty spaces, where each element corresponds to a position on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Printing the Tic-Tac-Toe Board**: The `print_board` function takes the `board` as input and displays the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. It prints the board's layout, including the player's moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Checking for a Win**: The `check_win` function is used to check if a player has won. It takes the `board` and the current player (\"X\" or \"O\") as input. It checks for win combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals. If any of these combinations are filled with the same player's marker, it returns `True`, indicating a win.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Checking if the Board Is Full**: The `is_board_full` function checks if the board is full, i.e., there are no empty spaces left. If all spaces are occupied, it returns `True`, indicating a tie.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Minimax Algorithm**: The `minimax` function is the heart of the AI player. It implements the minimax algorithm for decision making. The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that calculates the best move for a player by considering all possible moves and their outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It uses a `scores` dictionary with values for \"X\" (1), \"O\" (-1), and \"Tie\" (0).\n",
        "   - It checks if the game has been won by \"X\" or \"O\" or if it's a tie. If so, it returns the respective score.\n",
        "   - If it's the AI player's turn (is_maximizing), it maximizes its score by recursively exploring all possible moves and choosing the one with the highest score.\n",
        "   - If it's the player's turn (not maximizing), it minimizes the score by recursively exploring all possible moves and choosing the one with the lowest score.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Finding the Best AI Move**: The `find_best_move` function uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI player (\"X\"). It iterates through all empty spaces on the board, calculates the score for each move, and selects the move with the highest score.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Main Game Loop**: The `play_game` function is the main game loop.\n",
        "   - It starts by displaying a welcome message and the initial state of the board.\n",
        "   - The loop continues until the game is won or it's a tie.\n",
        "   - The player is prompted to enter their move (0-8), and the move is made if the selected space is empty. If not, an error message is displayed, and the player is prompted again.\n",
        "   - After the player's move, it checks if the player has won or if it's a tie.\n",
        "   - If the game hasn't ended, the AI opponent's move is determined using the `find_best_move` function, and the board is updated.\n",
        "   - It checks if the AI has won or if it's a tie.\n",
        "   - The game loop continues until there's a winner or a tie.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Running the Game**: The code block at the end (`if __name__ == \"__main__\"`) starts the game by calling the `play_game` function when the script is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this code implements a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you can play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves. The game continues until there's a winner or a tie, and the board's state is displayed after each move."
